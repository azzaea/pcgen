\usage{
res.covar.test(
  x,
  y,
  G,
  Z.t = NULL,
  K = NULL,
  X = as.data.frame(matrix(0, length(x), 0)),
  alpha = 0.01,
  use.manova = TRUE,
  max.iter = 50,
  stop.if.significant = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{trait vectors whose independence is to be tested, conditional on
G (genotype) and possible covariates in X. Manadatory}

\item{G}{Factor of genotypes. Manadatotry}

\item{Z.t}{Incidence (design) matrix linking observations (replicates) to unique
genotypes. Hence, in expriements without replicates, it becomes the
Identity matrix. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{K}{The kinship (i.e genetic relatedness matrix) . If \code{NULL} (the default),
independent genetic effects are assumed.}

\item{X}{A dataframe of possibly the covariates, traits and QTLs used as a
conditioning set. If not specified, this becomes a dependence test}

\item{alpha}{The significance level used in each conditional independence
test. Default is 0.01. The test itself of course does not depend on this,
but it is used in the EM-algorithm to speed up calculations. More
precisely, the EM-algorithm is stopped once the P value is below the
significance level. This can be done because the PC algorithm only needs an
accept/ reject decision.}

\item{use.manova}{Set to \code{TRUE} if your experimental design is balanced,
and there are replicates. This is the default value, and in this case,
MANOVA will set starting values for fitting. If there are no replicates,
the kinship matrix, \code{K}, should be supplied and this parameter set to
\code{FALSE}}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations in the EM-algorithm, used to fit
the bivariate mixed model (when \code{use.res = FALSE)}.}

\item{stop.if.significant}{If TRUE, the EM-algorithm used in some of the
conditional independence tests will be stopped whenever the p-value becomes
significant, i.e. below alpha. This will speed up calculations, and can be
done because (1) the PC algorithm only needs an accept/reject decision (2)
In EM the likelihood is nondecreasing. Should be put to FALSE if the
precise p-values are of interest.}
